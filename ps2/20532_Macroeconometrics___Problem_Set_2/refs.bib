    abstract = {This paper provides an analytical study of linear regressions involving the levels of economic time series. An asymptotic theory is developed for regressions that relate quite general integrated random processes. This includes the spurious regressions of Granger and Newbold (1974) and the recent cointegrating regressions of Granger and Engle (1985). An asymptotic theory is developed for the regression coefficients and for conventional significance tests. It is shown that the usual t- and F-ratio test statistics do not possess limiting distributions in this context but actually diverge as the sample size T ↑ ∞. The limiting behavior of regression diagnostics such as the Durbin–Watson statistic, the coefficient of determination and the Box–Pierce statistic is also analyzed. The theoretical results that we present explain many of the earlier simulation findings of Granger and Newbold, 1974, Granger and Newbold, 1977.}

     abstract = {The relationship between co-integration and error correction models, first suggested in Granger (1981), is here extended and used to develop estimation procedures, tests, and empirical examples. If each element of a vector of time series xt first achieves stationarity after differencing, but a linear combination $\alpha ^{\prime }x_{t}$ is already stationary, the time series xt are said to be co-integrated with co-integrating vector α. There may be several such co-integrating vectors so that α becomes a matrix. Interpreting $\alpha ^{\prime }x_{t}=0$ as a long run equilibrium, co-integration implies that deviations from equilibrium are stationary, with finite variance, even though the series themselves are nonstationary and have infinite variance. The paper presents a representation theorem based on Granger (1983), which connects the moving average, autoregressive, and error correction representations for co-integrated systems. A vector autoregression in differenced variables is incompatible with these representations. Estimation of these models is discussed and a simple but asymptotically efficient two-step estimator is proposed. Testing for co-integration combines the problems of unit root tests and tests with parameters unidentified under the null. Seven statistics are formulated and analyzed. The critical values of these statistics are calculated based on a Monte Carlo simulation. Using these critical values, the power properties of the tests are examined and one test procedure is recommended for application. In a series of examples it is found that consumption and income are co-integrated, wages and prices are not, short and long interest rates are, and nominal GNP is co-integrated with M2, but not M1, M3, or aggregate liquid assets.},
